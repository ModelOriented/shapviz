# shapviz 0.2.1

Hi CRAN team

I received this info about a note on html5 and fixed one problem by rerunning "document()".

"Dear maintainer,

Please see the problems shown on
<https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_shapviz.html>.

In particular, please see the "Found the following HTML validation
problems" NOTEs in the "HTML version of manual" check for the r-devel
debian checks results.[...]"

## Checks

- check_win_devel() -> Status: OK
- check_rhub(): Okay, until a message that h2o and lightgbm ("Enhances") are not available.
- check(manual = TRUE, cran = TRUE) -> warning on pdf compression.
