This is a resubmission of the initial CRAN release of this package.

The update fixes a mistake in correctly applying `geom_jitter()`. It would be fantastic to use this updated version (still kept at 0.1.0). Sorry for this extra turn.

Rhub did not find problematic things:

* Possibly misspelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  SHAP (2:8, 6:33, 8:68, 12:65)
  
* checking for detritus in the temp directory ... NOTE
Found the following files/directories:
  'lastMiKTeXException'
