# shapviz 0.9.3

Hi CRAN team

This is a relatively small update, but offers much more flexibility in the interaction heuristic.

## Checks look good

### check(manual = TRUE, cran = TRUE)

Ok

### RHub (usual notes)

* checking package dependencies ... NOTE
Packages which this enhances but not available for checking:
  'fastshap', 'h2o', 'lightgbm'
* checking HTML version of manual ... NOTE
Skipping checking math rendering: package 'V8' unavailable
* checking for non-standard things in the check directory ... NOTE
Found the following files/directories:
  ''NULL''
* checking for detritus in the temp directory ... NOTE
Found the following files/directories:
  'lastMiKTeXException'
  

### Winbuilder()

Status: OK

## Reverse dependencies (2)
